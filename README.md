# The Undisputed United (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Are you tired of hearing football pundits and commentators use the word "_United_" to refer to only one team during Manchester United vs Newcastle United? **The Undisputed United** fairly and scientifically calculates the one team that is truly allowed to be called United.



## Current Champion
 - **XXXXX**



## The Rules

Sheffield United became the first Undisputed United when they beat Newcastle United 1-2 in 1898 (see [History](#history)). From that point onwards, the winner of any regular season English Football League match between the defending champion and another United gains the title. In the event of a draw, the title remains with the defending champion.

The methodology is similar to that of the [Unofficial Football World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unofficial_Football_World_Championships).

Only regular season Football League matches from the top four tiers are included. Cups, playoffs and [test matches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_test_matches) are excluded.



## History
The first Football League match between two Uniteds<sup>1</sup> took place on 26th September 1898 in what was then the 1st Division, as Sheffield United and Newcastle United drew 2-2. The two sides met again only a few weeks later on 15th October 1898, with Sheffield United coming away with all two points<sup>2</sup> in a 1-2 victory.


#### _Notes_
1. Manchester United were called [Newton Heath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Manchester_United_F.C._(1878%E2%80%931945)) until 24th April 1902, and so aren't included until then.
2. A win was only worth two points until [1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_points_for_a_win#:~:text=It%20was%20introduced%20in%20England,as%20most%20national%20football%20leagues.).
